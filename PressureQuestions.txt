The accompanying dataset and script will help you have a look at the last year's worth of atmospheric pressure data from the UW Atmospheric Sciences building.

I Before you begin (think on these for a half-hour or so before you dig in):

1. What do you think the dataset will look like?

2. What features do you expect to see?

3. What features do you expect to see in the power spectrum?


II Time Domain

1. Plot it.

2. Nicely label the axes.

3. Does the dataset make sense? Does it align with your experience?

4. Does the sensor look like it was working correctly?

5. What is the dominant timescale of fluctuations?


III Frequency Domain


Subtract the mean pressure (to remove the DC power) and have a look at the power spectrum.

1. Nicely label the axes of the plot

2. Does the plot make any physical sense? Is the noise level reasonable?

3. What are the notable features of the power spectrum?

4. If there are lines, at which frequency do they appear?

5. If there are harmonics of a fundamental, are any of them abnormally large?

6. Why? What might that mean?

7. Are any of the peaks split? By how much? Why?

8. Are there any lines you'd expect to see but don't?


IV Digging deeper

1. What time of day (referenced to 0-seconds) generally has a higher pressure than the rest of the day?

2. Are there any other times of day that generally have higher pressure than other times?
